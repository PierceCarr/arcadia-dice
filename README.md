A Progressive Web App that simulates the special dice, and their unique multiplying 'critical' behaviour, in the popular tabletop game Arcadia Quest. As anyone who has played the title knows, the game does not come with enough dice for the situations you'll encounter in the later stages. For the average gamer, your only recourse is to dish out another $10-$15 to Cool Mini Or Not for a pack of 'bonus' dice. With the use of this app, you'll never have to mentally keep track of rolls in your head, or even look pleadingly into your friends eyes every turn and whimper, 'I need all your dice again.' 

Although it will run in any browser, it's best run on Android phones and tablets. As a PWA, you can install it on such devices and run it as an app. I host it on Heroku at [this link](https://arcadia-dice.herokuapp.com/). If downloading it through the chrome app, you'll want to use the 'three dot' menu to find the 'add to home screen' link. In firefox there should be a 'home screen' button beside the URL; tap that to install. The firefox version can sometimes experience a bit of a visual bug on the main app screen where the dice animation blinks, but the chrome version generally runs smooth and true

This project clearly has no affiliation with CMON (Cool Mini Or Not), Arcadia Quest's designers, or anyone commercially involved with the game.
